Hello Peter,
Please can you take out the trash from the office? I've forgot to do that and it needs to be done before tommorows meating with Samuel at 8:00.
Also can you please email him the aggenda today, include me in the copy too?

Btw: Don't forget about the BBQ on Sunday. Can you bring some beverages? I'll get the meat.

Thanks
John
